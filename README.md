# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this project is to help establish the "PlanMyTrip" app, which allows users to add desired weather information into the GUI. In return, the system provides the users with hotels, given their chosen criteria. Users are also able to visualize multiple options at once, and are also able to view each in the format of a travel route, provided by directions. For this project, I utiltized Pandas library, Google Maps and Directions APIs, Python language, and Jupyter Notebook.
